    </header>

    <p class="muted">
      This page is a general template and does not constitute legal advice. You should have a licensed attorney 
      review and customize these terms to make sure they fit your specific business and location.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
    <p>
      By submitting a booking request or receiving tattoo services from Luna at OZ Tattoo, you agree to these Terms of Service 
      and the accompanying Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not proceed with booking or receiving services.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Age Requirement</h2>
    <p>
      You must be at least 18 years of age (or meet the legal age requirement in your jurisdiction) to receive a tattoo. 
      Valid government-issued photo identification will be required at your appointment.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Booking and Deposits</h2>
    <p>
      Appointments may require a deposit to secure your booking. Deposits are non-refundable but may be transferable to a 
      future appointment if you provide adequate notice (typically 48-72 hours in advance). Failure to show up without notice 
      may result in forfeiture of your deposit and potential refusal of future bookings.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Health and Safety</h2>
    <p>
      You agree to disclose any relevant medical conditions, allergies, medications, or other health concerns that may affect 
      the tattooing process. You acknowledge that tattooing involves some level of risk, including but not limited to infection, 
      allergic reaction, or scarring, and that proper aftercare is essential to minimize these risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luna and OZ Tattoo follow strict health and safety protocols in accordance with state and local regulations. All equipment 
      is sterilized or single-use where appropriate.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Design Consultation and Approval</h2>
    <p>
      You will have the opportunity to review and approve the tattoo design before the work begins. Once you approve the design 
      and the tattoo is started, you accept responsibility for the final result. Minor adjustments can be discussed, but significant 
      changes mid-session may not be possible.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Aftercare</h2>
    <p>
      Proper aftercare is your responsibility. You will receive written and verbal aftercare instructions. Failure to follow 
      these instructions may result in infection, poor healing, or damage to the tattoo. Touch-ups due to improper aftercare 
      may incur additional fees.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Touch-Ups and Warranty</h2>
    <p>
      Minor touch-ups within a reasonable period (typically 30-60 days) after the initial session may be offered at no charge 
      or at a reduced rate, depending on the circumstances. This does not cover changes you decide you want later or damage 
      caused by improper aftercare.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Payment</h2>
    <p>
      Payment is due in full at the completion of your session unless other arrangements have been made in advance. Accepted 
      payment methods will be communicated during booking. Prices are subject to change based on design complexity and time required.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Photography and Portfolio Use</h2>
    <p>
      Luna may photograph your completed tattoo for portfolio, social media, or promotional purposes. If you do not wish your 
      tattoo to be photographed or shared, please inform the artist before your session.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the fullest extent permitted by law, Luna and OZ Tattoo are not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential 
      damages arising from your tattoo or the services provided. Your sole remedy for dissatisfaction is to discuss the matter 
      directly with the artist or studio management.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Conduct</h2>
    <p>
      You agree to behave respectfully toward the artist and studio staff. Disruptive, abusive, or intoxicated behavior may 
      result in termination of your session without refund.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Cancellation and Rescheduling</h2>
    <p>
      If you need to cancel or reschedule, please provide as much notice as possible (ideally 48-72 hours). Late cancellations 
      or no-shows may result in loss of deposit and potential difficulty booking future appointments.
    </p>

    <h2>13. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms of Service may be updated from time to time. Continued use of the booking system or services after changes 
      are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
    </p>

    <h2>14. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      These terms are governed by the laws of the State of California and the jurisdiction where OZ Tattoo operates. Any disputes 
      will be resolved in the appropriate courts of that jurisdiction.
    </p>

    <h2>15. Contact</h2>
    <p>
